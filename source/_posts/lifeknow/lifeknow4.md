Everytime, I always have so many feelings when i was on the railway. Look back the past, i have made so many choices which will decide my life in the future. And now, when i look back the every choice i made in the past, i have to thought that whether my life will be better if i make another choice. i think that the answer is not. a common bowl of noodles will make absolute different feeling for different people. a hungry people will get most satisfaction when he get that, but the rich people will not. this status mean what? i think this is 'too many we get, too many we lose'. sometimes, we just do not know what is our favourite things, so we always make mistakes in our life. of course, you must know that i am not a proponent of 'nihilism' which think everything do not have meaning. what i want to talk about is that which choice we make is not important, the important things is the porgress of that.<br>
too many people want to get the result of themselves' life, by contraies i think that what we should do just enjoy the progress of that. we get result of our life just a moment, so that the moment never be forever which can be the main part of us. however, the mind of we persist in the progress will be the most important things and help us through the whole life at least.
